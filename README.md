# Dockerfile Build Error: Missing requirements.txt or Incorrect File Path

This repository demonstrates a common error when building Docker images: issues with the `requirements.txt` file or the `CMD` instruction. The original `Dockerfile` contains errors leading to a failed build.  The corrected `Dockerfile_solution` provides a solution.

## Original Dockerfile (buggy)
The `Dockerfile` attempts to build a Python application but contains errors related to the `requirements.txt` file and the `CMD` instruction.

## Corrected Dockerfile (solution)
The `Dockerfile_solution` addresses these issues, ensuring a successful build.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the image using the original `Dockerfile`:
   ```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```
3. Observe the build failure.

## How to fix the bug
1. Replace the buggy `Dockerfile` with the `Dockerfile_solution`.
2. Build the image:
   ```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```
3. Verify the image builds successfully.
